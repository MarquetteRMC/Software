## Setup
If you are wishing to run gazebo and/or rviz using this code make sure build and source the catkin_make file individually. 

Building the catkin library: 
'''cd Software
catkin init
catkin build'''

Sourcing the files. Note this needs to be done in every new terminal that is created. Will be edited in future versions.
'source devel/setup.bash'
